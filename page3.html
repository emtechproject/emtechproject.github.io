                    <li><strong>EDUCATE YOURSELF</strong> - &nbsp;There are countless sites on the internet where you can learn about depression, its symptoms, and treatment options. Learn about informed consent and the legal aspects of treatment in your state. Read up on disability law as it applies to the mentally ill.</li>
                    <li><strong>PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES</strong>&nbsp;- Learn what depression feels like, the misconceptions about mental illness that they must deal with, and get the facts about what depression really is.</li>
                    <li><strong>TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF</strong> - Feelings of depression are contagious. Periodically take some time to step back from the situation and recharge your batteries. Unsure if you may be battling the same problems? This quiz can help you figure out if you need help, too.</li>

                    <li><strong>REMEMBER THAT IT'S OKAY TO FEEL UPSET, ANGRY OR FRUSTRATED&nbsp;</strong>- These feelings are a valid response to a very trying situation. Join a support group, talk with a close friend, or see a counselor. The important thing is to vent your frustrations rather than allowing them to build up inside.</li>
                    <li><strong>BE THERE FOR THEM&nbsp;</strong>- Give them a shoulder to cry on or just listen while they spill out their hearts to you. Be patient with them. Let them know that you care. Share the things you've learned while researching depression. Let them know it's not their fault, that they're not weak or worthless.</li>
                    <li><strong>MEDICATIONS AND THERAPY ARE CRUCIAL TO THEIR RECOVERY</strong>&nbsp;- Help keep them on track with treatment. Help to ease their fears about treatment by letting them know that they're not crazy.</li>

                    <li><strong>OFFER HELP IN WHATEVER FORM THEY WILL ACCEPT IT</strong> - This could be their faith in God, their love of their children, or anything else that makes them want to go on living. Find what works best for them and remind them of it whenever they're not sure they can hang on any longer. If they're suicidal, you may need to seek immediate help. There are some very valuable suicide resources on the internet that will help you to help your loved one cope with suicidal feelings as well.</li>
                    <li><strong>LOVE THEM UNCONDITIONALLY&nbsp;</strong>- Let them know it's their illness you're frustrated with, not them.</li>
